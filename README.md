# 🎭 Emotion Detection App using Machine Learning & NLP

"Text has emotions too — we just need Machine Learning to understand them."
- A professional end-to-end Emotion Detection Web Application built using Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Streamlit.
- This app analyzes user-entered text and predicts the underlying human emotion with confidence scores and interactive visualizations.

# 📌 Project Description

- The Emotion Detection App identifies emotions hidden in text such as Joy, Fear, Anger, Sadness, Surprise, and Love.
- It uses TF-IDF Vectorization and a trained ML classification model to convert text into numerical features and predict emotions accurately.

- The project demonstrates:
  - Real-world NLP workflow
  - Model deployment using Streamlit
  - Interactive UI + data visualization

# 🧠 Algorithm & Working

- 🔍 Step-by-Step Flow
1. Text Input from user
2. Text Vectorization using TF-IDF
3. Emotion Prediction using trained ML model
4. Probability Calculation for each emotion
5. Visualization using interactive charts
   
- "From raw text ➝ numerical vectors ➝ emotional intelligence."
